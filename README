We want to write notes for S.R.S Varadhan's Probability textbook published by the AMS. Prof. Varadhan's notes are brilliant, but hard-to-read for the beginner.

Goals:
1) Provide additional notes summaries and explanations to the text. 
2) Solve the problems in detail. 
3) A grander idea is as follows: its so much easier to follow mathematical text when someone talks you through it. It's even nicer when you pause the person's voice, do your own calculations, and then continue; i.e., mathematical texts might be easier to appreciate if they're accompanied by an audiobook. Why audio and not just elaborate notes: classroom teaching is more effective than reading book, where one can see formulas and hear the professor's insight simultaneously. But, one only learns math well if one works through exercises themselves. Hence the audiobook companion to the text might work. 

4) should be automatic now
